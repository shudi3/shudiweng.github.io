I am a doctoral student at [Information Science and Engineering](https://www.kth.se/is/ise) (ISE) division, [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.kth.se/eecs/) (EECS) at KTH, starting Jan 9th, 2023. Previously, I received a master's degree from Chalmers University of Technology in 2022, and a bachelor's degree from Beihang University in 2020. During my master's thesis, I had the opportunity to explore wideband localization under the supervision of [Fan Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QxeHvlwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Henk Wymeersch](https://sites.google.com/site/hwymeers/Home). Their passion and wisdom greatly enlightened my academic journey.

My current research focuses on federated learning over coded wireless networks, under the supervision of Prof. [Mikael Skoglund](https://people.kth.se/~skoglund/) and Prof. [Ming Xiao](https://www.kth.se/profile/mingx). During this journey, I was offered great freedom and patience by my supervisors, nourishing my independence and strengthening my confidence towards becoming an independent researcher. I am deeply grateful for this precious freedom.

In my spare time, I enjoy nature, drawing, reading, and sometimes gaming.
