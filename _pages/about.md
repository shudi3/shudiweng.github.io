I am a doctoral student at [Information Science and Engineering](https://www.kth.se/is/ise)(ISE) division, EECS school at KTH, starting Jan 9th, 2023. Previously, I received a master's degree from Chalmers University of Technology in 2022, and a bachelor's degree from Beihang University in 2020. During my master's thesis, I had the opportunity to explore wideband localization under the supervision of Fan Jiang and [Henk Wymeersch](https://sites.google.com/site/hwymeers/Home). This experience greatly influenced my academic path, fostering my development towards becoming an independent researcher.

My doctoral study shifts to federated learning over coded wireless networks, under the supervision of Prof. [Mikael Skoglund](https://people.kth.se/~skoglund/) and Prof. [Ming Xiao](https://www.kth.se/profile/mingx). My supervisors have offered me great freedom and patience, cultivating my independence and strengthening my confidence.
